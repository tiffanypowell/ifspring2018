			<p>
				I should ink my skin with your name<br>
				And take my passport out again and just replace it<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				See I could do without a tan on my left hand<br>
				Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle<br>
				And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				'Cause maybe you're lovable and maybe you're my snowflake<br>
				And your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter<br>
				I'll hold you in a cold place<br>
				And you should never cut your hair<br>
				'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me<br>
				But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?<br>
				Would you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?<br>
				And I know you love Shrek 'cause we've watched it twelve times<br>
				But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too<br>
				And if your DVD breaks today, you shoulda got a VCR<br>
				'Cause I never owned a Blu-Ray, true say<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				And now I've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me<br>
				And if I lost, I go all cross and chuck all the controllers at the TV<br>
				And then you'd laugh at me and be asking me if I'm gonna be home next week<br>
				And then you'd lie with me till I fall asleep<br>
				And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me<br>
				But maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up.<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				I think you hate the smell of smoke<br>
				You always tryna get me to stop<br>
				But you drink as much as me, and I get drunk a lot<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				So I'll take you to the beach and walk along the sand<br>
				And I'll make you a heart pendant with a pebble held in my hand<br>
				And I'll carve it like a necklace, so the heart falls where your chest is<br>
				And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach<br>
				And it falls just where it needs to be and rests peacefully<br>
				So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now<br>
				Against yours now<br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up.<br>
				Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up.<br>
				Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up.<br><br>
