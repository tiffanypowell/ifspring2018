	<h1>Feedback</h1>
	<h2>from Tiffany Powell</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Love the dogs!</li>
		<li>Images work pretty well! The second one could have a gradient overlay that goes from transparent on the left to more translucent on the right</li>
		<li>Play around with justification</li>
		<li>Third image looks little squashed</li>
		<li>For the third image mobile version, you could try moving the dog to the right or left so its half-shown to give you a darker space to put the text.</li>
		<li>First quote doesn't have a period?</li>
	</ul>
