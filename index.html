	<h1>Wake Me Up</h1>
	<h2>Ed Sheeran</h2>
	</section>
	<section class="verse">
	I should ink my skin<br>
	With your name<br>
	And take my passport out again<br>
	And just replace it	
	</section>
	<section class="verse">
	See I could do without a tan<br>
	On my left hand, where my fourth finger meets my knuckle<br>
	And I should run you a hot bath<br>
	And fill it up with bubbles	
	</section>
	<section class="verse">
	'Cause maybe you're lovable<br>
	And maybe you're my snowflake<br>
	And your eyes turn from green to gray and in the winter I'll<br>
	Hold you in a cold place<br>
	And you should never cut your hair<br>
	'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
	</section>
	<section class="chorus">
	And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me<br>
	But maybe I'm just in love when you <span id="special">wake me up.</span>
	</section>
	<section class="verse">
	And would you ever feel guilty<br>
	If you did the same to me<br>
	Would you make me a cup of tea<br>
	To open my eyes in the right way<br>
	And I know you love Shrek<br>
	'Cause we've watched it twelve times<br>
	But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too<br>
	And if your DVD breaks, today<br>
	You shoulda got a VCR<br>
	'Cause I never owned a Blu-Ray<br>
	True say
	</section>
	<section class="verse">
	And now I've always been shit at computer games and your brother always beats me<br>
	And if I lost, I go all cross<br>
	And chuck all the controllers at the TV<br>
	And then you'd laugh at me<br>
	And be asking me<br>
	If I'm gonna be home next week<br>
	And then you'd lie with me till I fall asleep<br>
	And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets
	</section>
	<section class="chorus">
	And you will never know just how beautiful you are to me<br>
	But maybe I'm just in love when you <span id="special">wake me up.</span>	
	</section>
	<section class="verse">
	I think you hate the smell of smoke<br>
	You always tryna get me to stop<br>
	But you drink as much as me<br>
	And I get drunk a lot
	</section>
	<section class="verse">
	So I'll take you to the beach<br>
	And walk along the sand And I'll<br>
	Make you a heart pendant<br>
	With a pebble held in my hand
	</section>
	<section class="verse">
	And I'll carve it like a necklace<br>
	So the heart falls where your chest is<br>
	And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach and it falls just where it needs to be<br>
	And rests peacefully<br>
	So you just need to breathe<br>
	To feel my heart against yours now<br>
	Against yours now	
	</section>
	<section class="chorus">
	'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you <span id="special">wake me up.</span><br>
	Or maybe I'm just in love when you <span id="special">wake me up.</span><br>
	Maybe I fell in love when you <span id="special">woke me up.</span>
	</section>
