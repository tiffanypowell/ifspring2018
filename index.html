		<br><br>
		<span>2.</span> I'm a design minor, and I was looking for a class that would count towards the minor that is also interesting to me! I really liked comp sci so I figured I would like this too. Plus, html is a useful language to know for anyone.
		<br><br>
		<span>3.</span> I took and TA-ed for CSE131. I loved it, and if I wasn't maxed out I would minor in comp sci!
		<br><br>
		<span>4.</span> At this point I don't know enough to know what I don't know, but my goal is to see websites and their design differently.
		<br><br>
		<span>5.</span> I expect you have to pay even more attention to the way people think/how they react to certain images and placements.
		<br><br>
		<span>6.</span> <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a>: I think Netflix has an effective design because its easy to use and understand. Things are organized in an intuitive way. It also has a dark color scheme that's easy on the eyes - perfect for when you're watching at night.
		<br><br>
		<span>7.</span> <a href="http://www.xmasclock.com/">Christmas Clock</a>: This is an example of effective communication because it immediately provides the information someone visiting this site would want to see.
		<br><br>
		<span>8.</span> <a href="https://ukutabs.com/">UkuTabs</a>: This is not the most visually appealing website by any means, but it does work very well and no other site has this wide of a ukulele tab and resource library. It is also very easy to use! When you scroll down a tab, the chord diagram follows with you, you can transpose songs easily, and the comments section is great for tips.
