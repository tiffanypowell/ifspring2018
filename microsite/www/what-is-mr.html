		<h1>What is Mixed Reality?</h1>
		<p>Mixed reality (MR), sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. Mixed reality takes place not only in the physical world or the virtual world, but is a mix of reality and virtual reality, encompassing both augmented reality and augmented virtuality via immersive technology. The most obtainainable display technology is the head-mounted display like Microsoft’s HoloLens released in March of 2016. However, more displays have been created like the cave automatic virtual environment in which the user interacts with a four-screen room and the head-up display where a transparent surface presents data layered over a user’s view.</p>

		<h2>What’s the difference between MR, AR and VR?</h2>
		<p>Mixed reality is a subset of augmented reality (AR), a direct or indirect live view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are “augmented” by computer-generated perceptual information. However, like not all rectangles are squares, not all AR technologies qualify as MR. For example, a smartphone app adding a figure to an environment through the screen is an AR experience, but lacks the same interactiveness of an MR experience. Apps, including Snapchat and Pokemon Go, have incorporated AR technology in their interfaces and revolutionized the way people use their devices.</p>
		<p>Virtual reality (VR), is a computer-generated scenario that simulates a realistic experience. Unlike MR which renders virtual content within a real environment, VR technology creates a completely new virtual environment. Although VR environments can imitate real life, its creation of a fictional world is not to be confused with AR that provides a live, direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment. An example of VR in practice is Microsoft’s HTC VIVE system that uses the technology to create interactive worlds for gamers to explore.</p>
		<h2>What are the dangers?</h2>
		<p>There’s still much to learn about MR’s potential applications and much to learn about its ramifications. VR health risks including falling, motion sickness, eye growth interference, and hearing damage apply to MR technologies as well. Time may also reveal currently undiscovered health risks.</p>
		<p>Another concern is MR’s potential to breach users’ privacy. Franziska Roesner from MIT Technology Review reflects, “You might find it a bit creepy that the device and its applications have access to a constant video and audio feed of your surroundings, not to mention that you’re being recorded by other people’s devices.” Despite the amazing possibilities of MR technology, its power could easily backfire.</p>
